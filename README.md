# Covid-19 Data Analysis
## Applied Data Science

### Introduction
This project was for Applied Data Science course at Bellevue University.  The goal was create different visual presentations for Covid-19 Data.

### Tools
* Tableau

### Data
The dataset for this project is The Movies Dataset found on Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset.  This dataset contains metadata for the Full MovieLens Dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/), which contains over 45,000 movies and over 26 million ratings from more than 270,000 users.  The Movies Dataset contains seven csv files of data out of which two files are subset data files.


### Conclusion
Different techniques can be used for recommendation systems.  In order to test the effectiveness of recommendations, the system should be deployed and customer actions should be monitored to determine if they watch movies based on the recommendations.
