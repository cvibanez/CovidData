## Applied Data Science

### Introduction
This project was for Applied Data Science course at Bellevue University.  The goal was create different visual presentations for Covid-19 Data.

### Tools
* Tableau

### Data
The datasets for this project can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website and healthdata.gov.  The datasets appear complete and clean.

*Vaccinations

### Conclusion
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to many infections and deaths across the country.
Testing efforts ramped up quickly, but the percentage of positive test results stayed relatively consistent.
Vaccines have greatly reduced the number of infections, and therefore deaths in the country.
Although the vaccines that are available are very effective, we must remain vigilant and follow the guidelines of the CDC.
